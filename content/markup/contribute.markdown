Genomer is developed by [Michael Barton][6], written in Ruby, and open sourced
under the [MIT license][1]. The code for both [genomer and scaffolder is
available on gitub][2]. In each case the master git branch contains the
latest stable version.

Genomer is actively developed and therefore patches and pull requests are
welcome. These should ideally be specified by [RSpec][4] unit tests.
[Cucumber][5] integration scenarios for new or changed behaviour are also very
welcome. Bug reports can be made using the github issue tracker at each
repository.
