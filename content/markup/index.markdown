Genomer is command line glue for genome projects. It simplifies the small but
tedious tasks required when finishing a genome. Genomer makes it easy to
reorganise contigs in a genome, map annotations on to the genome and generate
the files required to submit a genome.

Furthermore genomer aims make genome projects more reproducible and robust.
Genomer is designed to work well with build tools such as [GNU Make][make] and
revision control tools such as [git][git]. This makes genome projects easy to
share and reproduce.
